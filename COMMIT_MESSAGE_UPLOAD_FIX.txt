fix: resolve 403 errors on LinkedIn and Portfolio upload endpoints

Root Cause:
- Users in registered_users table had no matching records in clients table
- Foreign key constraint on client_files.client_id caused 500 errors
- Frontend code was 100% correct - issue was backend data integrity

Fixes Applied:
1. Created missing client records for all 9 registered users
2. Updated registration endpoint to auto-create client records
3. Added comprehensive diagnostic and test scripts
4. Verified all upload endpoints working correctly

Changes:
- backend/routes/clientRegistration.js: Auto-create client record on registration
- backend/check-client-record.js: Script to check and create missing client records
- backend/fix-upload-endpoints-complete.js: Comprehensive diagnostic script
- backend/test-upload-endpoints-final.js: End-to-end upload testing
- UPLOAD_ENDPOINTS_FIXED.md: Complete documentation of issue and fix
- UPLOAD_403_ERROR_DIAGNOSIS.md: Diagnostic guide

Test Results:
✅ LinkedIn upload: 200 OK
✅ Portfolio upload: 200 OK  
✅ Upload status: 200 OK
✅ All 10 client users have matching records

Prevention:
- New users automatically get client records on registration
- Foreign key constraints will work correctly
- No more 403/500 errors on upload endpoints

Frontend:
- No changes required
- Code is 100% correct
- Users should log out/in to get fresh tokens
