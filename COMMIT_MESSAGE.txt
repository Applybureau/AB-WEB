### 2. Strategy Call Communication Method
- Client books with 1-3 preferred time slots
- Admin confirms with communication method choice:

- Status tracking: pending → confirmed → completed
- Endpoints:
  * GET /api/admin/strategy-calls
  * POST /api/admin/strategy-calls/:id/confirm

### 3. Complete Client Card (Admin Dashboard)
